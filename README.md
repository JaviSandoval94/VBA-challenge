# Introduction
Stock market analysts often work with large, structured data sets to extract valuable market insights and make forecasts based on this data. The analysis of such sets often includes repetitive tasks which can be automated using VBA scripting. This project analyzes real stock market data to achieve the following goals for each analyzed year:
1. For each ticker symbol in the data set, get the yearly change, percent change and total stock volume.
2. Return the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume
3. Run through every worksheet, i.e. every year, by running the VBA script once.

# Data set
Stock data Excel file from 2014 to 2018. The complete analyzed data set can be found in the Excel files included in this repository. 

# Code description
This repository contains the VBA code in the `.vb` file. This script can be run in the `.xlsm` files as macros to get the corresponding results.

# Conclusions
VBA scripting can provide useful tools to perform analyses and data formatting in structured spreadsheets such as the ones found in Excel files. While this tool is extremely powerful when working with raw data, this can be more complicated when the files are given additional formatting, which is often the case with Excel files.
